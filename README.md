# RCRC Data Science
Collection of [data science](#datascience) projects and resources in the Red Cross Red Crescent Movement, roughly divided by area of application. Its main purpose is to raise awareness of what other National Societies are doing to motivate bilateral interchanges. If there is any error in the information provided please [open an issue](https://github.com/IFRCGo/rcrc-data-science/issues). If you want to add a new project, [send us an email](mailto:jmargutti@redcross.nl,paola.yela@ifrc.org) or [open a pull request](https://github.com/IFRCGo/rcrc-data-science/pulls).

## 2. Early Warning Early Action
| Project | Description | RCRC Member | Team | 
| --------------- | :-----: | :-----: | :----- |
| Community-Based Surveillance (CBS) | A platform that allows real-time detection, reporting, aggregation, and analysis of information on community health risks. Code available [here](https://github.com/IFRCGo/cbs).| Norwegian Red Cross, IFRC, Belgium Red Cross | CBS, Health,-. Contact [here](nyss@redcross.no). |

## Notes
<a name="datascience">Data science</a>: largely regarded as a blend of various tools, mathematical models, algorithms, Machine Learning (ML) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques that aim to discover patterns, correlations and relationships from data. The different “categories” of data science are not definitive, nor universally agreed on, which is why we use the expression “data science” to try and avoid excluding anything. Similar initiatives to this project are the [Catalogue Of Predictive Models In The Humanitarian Sector](https://centre.humdata.org/catalogue-for-predictive-models-in-the-humanitarian-sector/) and the [UNECE High-Level Group for the Modernisation of Official Statistics Machine Learning Project](https://statswiki.unece.org/display/ML/HLG-MOS+Machine+Learning+Project).
